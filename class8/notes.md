#Lists
lists are used to store multiple types

list initiation:

1.
number = list()
type <number> : <<class list>>

2. student = []
a list can be empty too,
Lists are indexed
   
Lists are mutable: i.e their content can be changed 
While a string isn't mutable: i.e we cannot reassign an
index directly without creating a new list  
Example  
```python
stringMe = "stdd"
stringMe[0] = s
<error>
```
