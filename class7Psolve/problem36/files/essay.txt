Let me tell you the story,
Of a man true born.

He opened his eyes to this world,
Around him was stinging light,
Causing him unimaginable pain,
So much so that he cried, to forget.

His people smiled at him in that state,
They all bid him salaam,
For that was his to bear.

Custom bid it,
Where he was to be kept,
With grandma,
For all his time.
