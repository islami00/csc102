# continue ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of the loop and starts the next iteration
# it allows for a condition to be set to skip to the statement at start of loop, while break does opposite, sending to
# the statement right after it.
# for loops are best for clear  ends, while loops are best for unclear ones.
