# with numbers
m = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

for i in m:

n = ["salim", "farouq", "sadiq","nana","khaDJ"]
# i is an iterative variable used to denote a random instance of n that follows that condition especially "in"
# so for i in n means there exists an i in n , and everywhere in the for block, i is the instance of the set
for i in n:
    print(i)

# i think i understand how (lists? work, in assignment that is. Now all that's left is adding elements to have an
# infinite condition test
